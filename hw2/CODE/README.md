TO RUN THE CODE JUST RUN "bash tester.bash" 
THE COMMAND FOR THE PLOTS HAS BEEN COMMENTED OUT AND INCLUDED AT THE END OF THE FILE. THE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT THE TOOL PROVIDED WAS USED FOR ALL PLOTS AND TO PLOT THE FIGURES YOU WILL NEED TO MANUALLY CHANGE 
THE DATES IN THE FILES. REPLACE THE SECTION  THAT CONTAINS THE NAME AND UNCOMMENT THE LINE.

THE LAST PLOT WILL NOT CALL TO THE RESULTS OF THE COMMANDS UNDER PROBLEM 8. THERE IS A BUG IN PLOTTING THIS PART AND YOU NEED TO GO INTO THE FOLDER TO CHANGE "exp_name" IN THE JSON FILE. TO AVOID CONFUSION I INCLUDED A FOLDER CALLED test2 WITH THE RESULTS I OBTAINED AND THE CORRECTION ALREADY DONE. SO THE LAST FEW LINES WILL JUST ACCESS THIS PREMADE FILES.
